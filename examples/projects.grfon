{   shortName: FuelDepot
    displayName: Fuel Depot
    description: An orbital fuel depot enables buying and selling of fuel in orbit.  This opens new business opportunities, and can resupply larger facilities in cislunar space.

{   shortName: NEARetrieval
    displayName: NEA Retrieval
    benefit: LowerCost
    description: The first retrieval of a Near Earth Asteroid provides a cache of valuable materials in orbit, and provides experience in manipulating large orbits in space.

{   shortName: SSP
    displayName: Space Solar Power
    benefit: NewPart
    description: A space solar power station captures the abundant free energy of the Sun, and can beam it to customers anywhere in cislunar space.  The recipient needs only a simple microwave rectenna to receive steady, low-cost electricity.

{   shortName: NukePower
    displayName: Nuclear Power
    description: Fission plants aren't new, but only a few have been flown in space, and those were very small.  Somebody's got to build a big one â€” and once it's been done once, we'll know how to power our cities with them!

{   shortName: L1Station
    displayName: L1 Station
    benefit: NewOrbit
    description: A space station at the Earth-Moon L1 point is always in view of both Earth and Moon, and easy to reach from either.  It forms a critical transfer point for people, goods, and materials throughout cislunar space.

{   shortName: GasGun
    displayName: Gas Gun Launcher
    benefit: LowerCost
    description: Basically a mountain-sized gun for launching things from Earth into space, a gas gun would squish passengers into a thin smear on the back wall... but it's great for launching bulk materials very cheaply.
