// This is an example of a malformed GRFON file.
// We have a what looks like a key/value pair in a collection,
// but with no value before the collection is closed.

// Behavior of GRFON in this case is undefined, but it should
// handle it either by throwing an error, or by recovering
// gracefully and reporting the rest of the data correctly
// (e.g., bamf should be 42 in this example).

foo: bar
baz: {
    this is the bug: //right here
}
bamf: 42
